        <div class="box"> <p>Task Manager (Object Oriented Programming): <br> Using object oriented programming, me and my group members made a Task Manager using python code. Its purpose was to serve as 
        an agenda for both personal and academic needs. Creating this project helped us grow many of our skills in python and was a useful way to connect OOP concepts to our daily lives.</p>  </div>
        <div class="box"><p>Excel Calculator (Business Analytics): <br> Using VBA functions in excel, I made a Future Value of an Annuity Calculator. The purpose of this was to apply our VBA skills 
            towards creating an application that would calculate financial calculations, generate graphs and compile reports.</p></div>
        <div class="box"><p>Calculate (Computer Architecture): <br> I applied my knowledge of low level logic gates and binary operations to build a basic calculator. This project enhanced my
            skills with digital systems. </p></div>
        <div class="box"><p>Excel Dashboard (Business Analytics) <br> To show data in a visual format using graphs and charts compiled into a dashboard in excel. This project strengthened my data 
            visualization skills, excel skills and analytical skills. </p></div>
        <div class="box"><p>Jumble Player Game (Introduction to Programming) <br>I created a guessing game with python where the player has to unscramble the right word. This was another beginner 
            level project that helped familiarize myself with concepts like string manipulation and designing a user interface. </p></div>
        <div class="box"><p>Python Math Game (Grade 10 Computer Science) <br>Made a math quiz game that helps students practice basic arithmetic skills. This was an easy project since it was a lot of 
            python basics and served as a practice for those basic python concepts like loops and user input.  </p></div>
