# Portfolio
Assignment 1 of Web and Script Programming, the portfolio.

Code Source: Most of the code is from the lectures and tutorials, they've just been customized and readjusted.
One thing from outside the lecture code is the <br> tag I used to separate lines. I found this code in the W3 Schools website: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp


All the images and the video used in the page are things I made myself.
