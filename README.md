Assignment 1 of Web and Script Programming, The Portfolio.
This project has 4 html files(and one css file for each html file) along with 3 more css files for fluid designs. These separate css files allows the website to be properly visible on different viewports like desktop, tablet and mobile. 

Code Source: Most of the code is from the lectures and tutorials, they've just been customized and readjusted.
One thing from outside the lecture code is the <br> tag I used to separate lines. I found this code in the W3 Schools website: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp

Media used: All the images and the video used in the page are things I made myself.

Colour Scheme: the color pallete I chose was a shade of purple pallets that I found on the adobe link provided in the assignment. I chose this because the colors looked nice and applied these colors in multiple areas of my portfolio. 

Gradients: I applied a linear gradient background in the home.css file so it shows on the home page of the website.

Dimensions for the fluid designs: for these dimensions I decided to stick with the same dimensions for each page. For desktop it was 960px or bigger, for tablet is was 481px to 960px and for mobile it was less than 480px. I used these numbers specifically because they're close to how big each of the screens on these viewports would be. 

Version Control: I started pushing all my code to github on Monday sept 28, even though I started the code a day before. Every day since the 28th, at the end of the day or when I've done something major (like finish a page or fix a big bug) I pushe my code to git hub.
